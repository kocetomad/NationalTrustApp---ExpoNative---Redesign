# National Trust app redesign
This app aims to redesign the national trust app by making in more intuative and streamlined.
The UI design is based on the Airbnb design language patterns. Som functional patterns have been
moddeled based on the Airbnb app as well, the focused area filtering. 

The data used for the app comes part from the national trust API and part from the decompiled cache of 
the original application.
