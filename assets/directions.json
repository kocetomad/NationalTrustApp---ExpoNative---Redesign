Follow the path upward through the field, crossing into a second field via a gate at the top of the hill. Continue to follow the path, which will lead you across and out of the field to join on to a tarmacked lane, Hatt Lane. Head right here until you meet a small junction which joins Hatt Lane up to Oakley Road. Head right along this road, following the finger post to Mottisfont. This is a quiet country road, but it’s narrow with quite sharp turns in places and some poor visibility ahead, so please be careful while you walk.

In advance of the Waddesdon Greenway, a new safe cycle and walking route joining Aylesbury Vale Parkway to Waddesdon Manor being open, we are allowing cyclists to use their bikes on the main route through the grounds.  On arrival you will be directed to our Welcome Pavilion, where you'll need to purchase a grounds entry ticket, or show your National Trust membership card. If you wish you may leave your bike in our sheltered rack next to the electric charging points and continue into the grounds via our free shuttle bus. Alternatively, you may cycle up to the Manor along the main entrance road. Please dismount when you reach the closed main gate, and walk your bike through using the side pedestrian gate. Once through this gate you may continue cycling on the entrance road to the North Fountain. At this point a member of staff will show you where to safely leave your bike in a sheltered bike rack.  You may wish to continue cycling to the Stables using the main entrance road where there is another sheltered bike rack in the parking area.  When you are ready to leave, you can cycle down the exit drive, taking a right at the bottom onto Green Lane, and then back to the car park/Greenway, or exit via Silk Street and onto the A41.",
