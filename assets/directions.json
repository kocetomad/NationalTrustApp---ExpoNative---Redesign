   "description": "Stonehenge Down is a 2 mile (3.2km) walk from Amesbury. There are several routes along byways and bridleways, either across Countess Farm or Coneybury Hill. Larkhill is 1 mile (1.6km) away across bridleways. Durrington Walls is Â¾ mile (1.2km) from Durrington and 1Â½ miles (2.4km) from Amesbury, along small roads and bridleways. From Amesbury you can use an underpass to get under the A303 roundabout, then use the pavements along the A345 (Countess Road). Next to Woodhenge the old A345 still exists, running parallel to the current road, where you can safely walk along the grass verge near the top end of the roundabout.",

Pass under the bridge and turn right at the mini roundabout. Follow the road through two sets of traffic lights close together and turn left into Hogfair Lane. Follow this lane into Burnham village, past the grammar school on your right. In the village, follow the road round a sharp right-hand bend, keeping The Bee pub on the corner on your right. Take the 5th turning (signed posted âDorneywood 1â) which forks to the right onto Dorneywood Road. Follow the road carefully for about a mile (it is very narrow in places). The entrance to Dorneywood is on the right behind solid black gates.   NB: for public open days, parking signs will direct all visitors to the car-parking area.  ",
