A peninsula on the East Antrim coast steeped in history with cottages, rolling fields, quiet villages and spectacular coastline, it is a microcosm of the Northern Ireland countryside.</p>

<p>The name &#39;Islandmagee&#39; hails from the Gaelic &#39;Oile&aacute;n MhicAodha&#39; meaning &#39;MacAodha&#39;s island&#39;, the clan whose home was once at Portmuck, one of three stretches of coastline and countryside on the peninsula owned and managed by the National Trust.</p>

<p>Portmuck itself is a beautiful harbour located on the northwest coastline and steeped in history, from the site of an ancient monastery and castle to smuggling, lime production and fishing. Now it is a centre of leisure for the community and beyond, with a picnic area and clifftop walks offering views across the Irish Sea.</p>

<p>Keep a eye out for Kittiwakes, Guillemots and Razorbills around the wonderful &#39;pig-shaped&#39; Isle of Muck nearby.</p>

<p>Further to the northeast, you&#39;ll find Brown&#39;s Bay, with its sandy beach is an ideal starting point for walking to Skernaghan Point with its spectacular views of the famous Antrim coast.</p>

15,79,Clandon Park,ClandonPark,clandonpark@nationaltrust.org.uk,+441483222482,"<p>The house we see today at Clandon Park was built in the early 1730s to impress and entertain. Thomas Onslow and his wife Elizabeth Knight demolished an earlier Jacobean house to make way for their cutting-edge Palladian mansion and employed people and materials from across the globe to create and furnish the house. These included Italian architect, Giacomo Leoni, and leading European sculptors.</p>

<p>The house was built using money in part generated from the transatlantic slave trade. In 1706, Elizabeth inherited a huge fortune from her uncle, Charles Knight, a plantation owner and enslaver. This fortune passed to Thomas Onslow in 1708 when they married, and a Jamaican plantation continued to provide the family with an income until it was sold by the third Earl around 1832. Thomas Onslow was also a founding member of a marine insurance firm, which insured ships transporting enslaved people from Africa to the West Indies.</p>

<p>The Onslows were an ambitious family in law, trade and politics and their new house helped to cement their social and political influence around Guildford and Surrey. Its most famous room was the Marble Hall, an elegant and imposing white cube imitating marble, with an elaborate stucco ceiling and richly carved marble fireplaces by leading sculptors of the day.</p>

<p>The house you can explore today has been transformed by fire as well as fashion. In April 2015 a huge blaze gutted the house, leaving it open to the skies. Although the fire destroyed much of the house&rsquo;s interior &ndash; revealing how it was constructed and crafted &ndash; elements of this remarkable space and others survive, including the dining room, known as the &lsquo;Speakers Parlour&rsquo;, as well as the kitchen and other basement rooms.</p>

<p>We plan to remake and reimagine the house at Clandon Park, and we&rsquo;ve worked hard to open the house for visitors while we develop our plans. Once you&rsquo;ve donned your hard hat and high vis jacket, two purpose-built walkways take you inside the ruined house. You&rsquo;ll see the spaces burnt out by the fire, taking in the poetic grandeur of a great house laid bare.</p>

<p>Outside in the garden, you&rsquo;ll encounter Clandon&rsquo;s unique connection to New Zealand. William, 4th Earl of Onslow, served as Under Secretary of State for the Colonies and later Governor of New Zealand from 1888-92. When returning from New Zealand, he purchased Hinemihi, a Māori meeting house and brought her back to England. Māori people believe that Hinemihi is alive &ndash; that she is a living embodiment of their ancestor, Hinemihi, who lived several centuries ago. Hinemihi now sits in the grounds at Clandon Park, where she is at the heart of ceremonial events and celebrations for the UK Māori community. The National Trust, supported by the current Earl of Onslow, recently agreed in principle to a request by the Māori tribe who created Hinemihi that her historic carvings be returned to New Zealand. In exchange her tribe will create carvings for a new meeting house at Clandon to keep this relationship alive for current and future generations.</p>

<p>If you visit today, you&rsquo;ll see an English country house laid bare.&nbsp; The fire has stripped this &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; home back to its bones, revealing a place created by people, ideas and materials from all over the world. A place of beauty, but also one embodying difficult and sometimes over-looked histories. It&rsquo;s a chance to get to grips with the huge heritage challenge we face and to share your ideas about the house&rsquo;s future with us as we develop our plans.</p>

<p>The house and surrounding landscape were in keeping with the style expected in Georgian society, yet behind the formality lies a story of theatricality and mischief.</p>

<p>Known as the &lsquo;Gay Delavals&rsquo; due to their high spirited and flamboyant lifestyle, an invitation to one of their parties was the hottest ticket in town. In an age notorious for extremes of behaviour, they stood apart as the most notorious of all Georgian partygoers and pranksters. Imagine awaking in the house to find your room &ldquo;turned upside down&rdquo; with furniture fixed to the ceiling, or finding yourself in a state of undress and having the walls collapse!</p>

<p>Enter a world where an extraordinary lifestyle was acted out in the most colourful way. The Delavals loved a performance, staging events from rope dancers and sack races outdoors to masquerade balls and even their own theatrical productions at home and further afield, which earned rave reviews at the time.</p>

<p>Seaton Delaval Hall has moved from fortune to misfortune many times through the centuries and the story of its survival is as dramatic as any performance that could be staged. It still bears the scars of the fierce fires which almost condemned it to ruin two hundred years ago, but even today plays a major part in the history of the North East.</p>

<p>Now&nbsp;Seaton Delaval Hall is embarking on its&nbsp;encore thanks to the National Lottery Heritage Fund and others.&nbsp; Between 2019 and 2022 the Hall completed a major project titled the &#39;Curtain Rises&#39;, which included&nbsp;a full reroofing of the West Wing, replacement of six chimneys and the introduction of conservation-grade heating; critical repairs to the cantilever staircases leading from the Central Hall to the&nbsp;Basement;&nbsp;the reflooring&nbsp;and introduction of&nbsp;sympathetic lighting in the Basement;&nbsp;conservation of structures in the landscape including the&nbsp; ha-ha walls, mausoleum and walled garden walls, a contemporary reimagining of the 1781 estate plan in the landscape, incorporating the reintroduction of historic path networks&nbsp;and improvements to visitor facilities including a new cafe, play area, accessible entrances&nbsp;and toilets. In addition, the hall&#39;s collection has been re-presented to better introduce the &#39;gay Delavals&#39;- and better tell their stories, bringing back the drama and flamboyance for which they were known.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had inherited Wightwick in 1900, a house designed in an &lsquo;Old English&rsquo; style by Midlands architect Edward Ould and built for his parents, Theodore and Flora Mander, between 1887&ndash;1893.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While they lived in the house, Theodore and Flora took inspiration from Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s lecture on &#39;the House Beautiful&#39;; as a result, the interiors reflect Wilde&rsquo;s commitment to the principles of the Aesthetic Movement and the ideals of &lsquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake&rsquo;. Wilde&rsquo;s influence can be seen in the collection of objects from Japan and China and the designs of William Morris and his British Arts and Crafts contemporaries.</p>

<p>Having given the house to the Trust, Geoffrey and his second wife Rosalie became its live-in curators, opening the house to the public and adding to its contents, in particular a remarkable collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, Marie Spartali Stillman, Elizabeth Siddal and many others. The collection now forms one of the largest public collections of work by female artists in Britain.</p>

It is the creation of the tenacious Duchess of Lauderdale and her husband, the Duke, who together transformed Ham into one of the grandest Stuart houses in England.</p>

<p>Ham House is internationally recognised for its superb collection of paintings, furniture and textiles, largely brought together 400 years ago. Some of our unique objects include a rare Chinese teapot, one of the earliest and said to have been used by the Duchess herself, and an exceptional ivory cabinet. The house is reputed to be one of the most haunted in Britain. Some visitors have reported the ghostly aroma of the sweet Virginia pipe tobacco that the Duke smoked after meals in the dining room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside, the open and formal restored 17th-century gardens surround the house. It includes a productive kitchen garden containing many heritage crops, the maze-like &lsquo;Wilderness&rsquo;, complete with summerhouses, and many beautiful spots perfect for a picnic.</p>

John de Throckmorton, Under Treasurer of England to Henry VI, acquired Coughton in the early 15th Century through his marriage to Eleanor de Spiney. Their descendants have held it for 600 years and, although the National Trust has owned the house since 1946, the family still live here. The present resident, Mr Magnus Birch-Throckmorton, and his family enjoy occupancy of the house under a 300 year lease.</p>

<p>The origins of Coughton Court lie in pre-conquest times and there is evidence of a house on this site from the 14th Century. The present building was begun in the 15th Century and has since survived in a family who for much of that time were impoverished, persecuted or imprisoned for their adherence to the Catholic faith.</p>

<p>Explore this story of fascinating personalities through the &#39;family album&#39; of portraits and Catholic treasures around the house. Coughton is still very much a family home with an intimate feel and the family still manage the stunning gardens which they have created.</p>

<p>There is still more to enjoy away from the house and gardens. For the little ones an activity shed with a wealth of games and activities to keep them busy and for those seeking something a little less energetic then a stroll through our ancient woodland, to be found awash with bluebells in the spring, or a visit to the&nbsp;cafe for a relaxing cream tea.</p>

Its architecture was influenced by prison design and its harsh regime became a blueprint for workhouses throughout the country.</p>

<p>This rural workhouse was designed to house around 160 inmates. They lived and worked in a strictly segregated environment with virtually no contact between the old and infirm, able-bodied men and women and children</p>

<p>The stories of those who lived and worked here in the 1840s help bring the building to life and prompt reflection on how society has tackled poverty through the centuries.</p>

<p>During the Second World War Croome was used as a secret wartime airbase. Learn more about this fascinating period, and the activities of the many people who worked here, in the RAF museum located at the visitor centre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the spirit of the 6th Earl, today we invite collaboration with contemporary artists and craftspeople to creatively re-interpret the many stories of Croome and its surviving collections, exploring themes such as its time as a boys&rsquo; school and as the home of Hare Krishna devotees.

<p>Born in 1874 Churchill started his life as a soldier and journalist and travelled the world. He would go on to serve as Prime Minister twice, as a member of Parliament for over 60 years under five different monarchs and to lead Britain to victory in the Second World War. He lived an exceptionally long political life and is both a celebrated and contested figure.</p>

<p>He loved Chartwell. Here Churchill was a politician and statesman but also a husband, father, writer, painter and garden planner. It remained important to him until his death in 1965. The rooms in the house remain much as they were when he lived here, with pictures, books and personal mementoes while a special exhibition gives deeper insight into his life through 50 objects.</p>

<p>Chartwell&rsquo;s hillside gardens reflect his love of landscape and nature. They include the lakes he created, the kitchen garden and the Marycot, a playhouse designed for his youngest daughter Mary. Beyond the gardens there is expansive woodland with looped trails and natural play areas, there is den building and a Canadian camp and opportunities to&nbsp;enjoy the outdoors.</p>

<p>Created from an abandoned farmyard and surrounding an attractive Elizabethan manor house, these 20th-century gardens are experimenting with a Mediterranean-style planting scheme to take advantage of the warm, southerly location. Here the tall leaves of exotic plants fill the borders whilst a young olive grove is establishing itself on the high banks.</p>

Follow the network of footpaths that criss-cross the area and you&rsquo;ll travel back in time past Bonze Age barrows and the Neolithic Longstone.</p>

<p>Today the land is still cared for in a nature-sensitive way. Walk along any of the paths and you might spy butterflies gathering nectar from wild flowers, or rare birds in the wide skies overhead. In the summer, the elusive Nightjar even makes its home here on the common.</p>

Drygarn Fawr is the highest point on the commons, lying above the Nant Irfon valley. From its summit it&#39;s possible to walk eastwards along the entire ridge almost on the level.</p>

<p>To the south, complex, steep - and sometimes craggy - valleys dip and sweep away from the ridge. To the north the ground falls away more gently to the edge of the Elan Valley reservoir. Walking along the bottom of these sheltered valleys, alongside rushing streams and through mature Oak woods, it&#39;s difficult to believe it&#39;s the same place.</p>

<p><strong>Wild, remote and ancient</strong></p>

<p>The summit ridge is a wild and bleak landscape with grand, spacious, expansive views across the roof of Wales. A walk across Abergwesyn can bring the experience of solitude, loneliness, remoteness or freedom in equal measure.</p>

<p>The commons are rich in archaeology, from Bronze Age ritual sites to deserted medieval villages. Wherever you walk you&#39;re likely to come across a cairn - a stone circle - or standing stone and other evidence of human activity dating back hundreds, if not thousands, of years.</p>

<p>You can spy Red Grouse amongst the heather, and watch out for Lapwing, Golden Plover and Red Kite. Abergwesyn is altogether a truly splendid place.</p>

<p>One of Wimpole&rsquo;s owners was Attorney-General Philip Yorke. His opinion that an enslaved person did not become free on reaching English soil governed legal thought on slavery for nearly half a century.</p>

<p>The present house, at the heart of this estate, was the vision of Elsie Bambridge. Wimpole had been an empty shell until she filled it with pictures and furniture, bringing it back to a welcoming home in the 1930s.</p>

Tennyson Down is probably one of the most popular places to walk on the Island. You can enjoy it just for the great leg-stretch from Freshwater Bay to the Needles Headland, and drink in the salt laden air that so inspired Tennyson. However every time you visit, the light and weather conditions are different so it is well worth returning.</p>

<p><strong>A great place to be</strong><br />
You are perched above high chalk cliffs and transluscent seas that reflect the light in so many different ways. Amongst the gorse bushes are small birds and thousands of minute downland flowers and cliff nesting birds soar effortlessly along the cliff tops using the updrafts.</p>

<p><strong>Downland management&nbsp; today</strong><br />
We are restoring more of Tennyson Down back to open chalk grassland. Since the 1920s the Downs had fewer grazing animals, which allowed the whole of the sheltered north side of the Down to grow up with young ash woodland and many of the chalk grassland flowers and butterfies have disappeared. Cattle have been reintroduced to the Down and areas of young ash trees are being removed where the soil is suitably thin to allow the chalk grassland to gradually return and provide more wonderful open downland to wander across.</p>

<p>Built to honour the &#39;forgotten dead&#39; of the First World War, who were not remembered on any official memorials, the series was inspired by Spencer&rsquo;s own experiences as a medical orderly at the Beaufort Hospital in Bristol and both orderly and&nbsp;soldier on the Salonika front. It is peppered with personal and unexpected details and uniquely shows the everyday activities rather than the horrors of war. Inspired by Giotto&#39;s Arena Chapel in Padua and made possible through the generous patronage of Louis and Mary Behrend, Spencer referred to Sandham Memorial Chapel as his &quot;Holy Box&quot;. The 19 oil paintings covering three walls&nbsp;of the chapel&nbsp;took six years to complete&nbsp;and are considered by many to be the artist&rsquo;s finest achievement.</p>

<p>The chapel holds&nbsp;services throughout the year, the most important of these being the annual Armistice event. There are also&nbsp;regular talks in the Chapel about its creation and the paintings themselves, as well as a lively programme of workshops and events.</p>

<p>There is an&nbsp;exhibtion area in one of the original almshouses which are&nbsp;decorated in period colours and style.

Lewis to write The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.</p>

<p>One of the last active granite quarries in the Mournes is Thomas&#39;s Quarry. It is from here the 47 tonne, 40 feet (12m) long Delamont Millennium stone was quarried, the highest modern standing stone in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Another place to explore is Bloody Bridge. The name refers to a massacre at the site during the 1641 rebellion; the bodies of slain prisoners were thrown over the bridge into the river, turning the water red.</p>

<p>575 Wandsworth Road was acquired by the National Trust in 2010, because of the rich and striking interiors created by Khadambi Asalache (1935-2006), a Kenyan-born poet, novelist, philosopher of mathematics and British civil servant. He bought the house in 1981 while working at the Treasury, and over a period of 20 years (from 1986) turned his home into a work of art.</p>

<p>Prompted by the need to disguise persistent damp in the basement dining room, he initially fixed pine floorboards to the damp wall. He went on to embellish almost every wall, ceiling and door in the house with exquisite fretwork patterns and motifs, which he hand-carved from reclaimed pine doors and floorboards found in skips.</p>

<p>The house stands as he left it, with his painted decoration on walls, doors and floors and with rooms furnished with his handmade fretwork furniture and carefully arranged collections of beautiful and functional objects, including pressed-glass inkwells, pink and copper lustreware, postcards and his typewriter.</p>

A staunch anti-abolitionist, Richard Pennant&#39;s fortune &ndash; acquired from sugar plantations in Jamaica that used enslaved labour &ndash; funded roads, railways, schools, hotels, workers&rsquo; houses, churches and farms in North Wales. The Penrhyn Slate Quarry and Port Penrhyn, established by the Pennants, dominated the Welsh slate industry for almost 150 years. Penrhyn Castle&rsquo;s vast rooms, rich neo-Norman architecture and opulent furnishings are steeped in these colonial histories.&nbsp;</p>

Covering an area of 10.5 acres the garden takes visitors on a journey through intimate formal areas revealing a different atmosphere or new vista at every turn. Smaller, more formal garden &lsquo;rooms&rsquo; near the house, give way to more natural areas that blend in with the surrounding countryside further away. There is a central axis running from East to West and another North to South, forming corridors off which the garden rooms can be found, each one with its own character and personality.</p>

<p>Using Hidcote as a &lsquo;blank canvas&rsquo;, Lawrence Johnston designed the garden in phases from 1907 to 1938. He furnished borders with newly discovered plants and exotic rarities gathered during plant hunting expeditions from around the world. As a member of both the Garden Society and the Royal Horticultural Society, Johnston and the name &lsquo;Hidcote&rsquo; have become synonymous with the best forms of many plants, such as <em>Hypericum </em>&lsquo;Hidcote&rsquo;<em>, Lavandula </em>&lsquo;Hidcote&rsquo; and <em>Rosa </em>&lsquo;Lawrence Johnston&rsquo;<em>.</em></p>

<p>Major Johnston was also described by many as the &lsquo;most generous&rsquo; of hosts and gardeners, sharing seeds and cuttings with friends, delighting in garden parties, and even opening the doors to Hidcote to the public on a few days each year.</p>

<p>In 1948 Lawrence Johnston gifted Hidcote, now a Grade I listed garden, to the National Trust, becoming the first garden-only property in the Trust&rsquo;s care. Using contemporary photographs and accounts to guide our vision, we continue to care for it for future generations to enjoy.</p>

346,266,Powis Castle and Garden,PowisCastleandGarden,powiscastle@nationaltrust.org.uk,+441938551944,"<p>Powis Castle, a medieval fortress built in the 13th&nbsp; century by the Welsh ruler of Powys, Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn, sits high on a rock above its world-famous garden in Welshpool.</p>

<p>By the late 13th century, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd had established himself as Prince of Wales, and in 1274 he destroyed Powis Castle, forcing Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn into exile. However, within three years Llywelyn&rsquo;s principality had crumbled leaving Gruffudd of Powys to regain his lordship and rebuild the castle.</p>

<p>The castle then passed on to the Charltons in the 1300s, followed by the Tiptofts and Greys. Years of neglect left the castle in need of considerable restoration, until the 1530s when Edward Grey began a major re-building programme, transforming Powis Castle into the most imposing noble residence in North and Central Wales. Edward Herbert, second son of the Earl of Pembroke, continued this re-modelling when he purchased the castle in the 1580s and created the Elizabethan Long Gallery, the oldest surviving interior of the castle.</p>

<p>Remodelled and embellished over more than 400 years, the castle and garden you see today reflects the changing ambitions and visions of the Herbert family, who occupied the castle from the 1570s. Each generation enlisted artists to embellish and refine the castle and to contribute to&nbsp;the family&rsquo;s collection of paintings, sculptures, furniture and tapestries on view throughout the property.</p>

<p>Below the castle&nbsp;lies a garden steeped in history. Considered one of the finest surviving examples of its kind, dancing statues lead you along Italianate terraces, and grand staircases show you the way to colourful herbaceous borders and stretches of impeccably mowed lawns.</p>

<p>The 30ft high, cloud-like yew trees spill over the terraces and are a real showstopper. Surviving changes in style, design, and fashion over hundreds of years, today these unique and character filled topiary hedges are carefully trimmed by a team of dedicated gardeners every autumn.</p>

<p>Powis also holds one of the UK&rsquo;s most significant collections of south Asian objects, housed in the Clive Museum. The collection was amassed by Robert Clive and his son Edward (later 1st Earl of Powis), major figures in the British East India Company. The third contributor was Henrietta Herbert who Edward Clive married, thus uniting the two families. The story behind the objects in the collection is not always clear and although some items were purchased or received as gifts, others were acquired following the defeat and death of Tipu Sultan by British troops at the Siege of Seringapatam in 1799. The Clive family wealth amassed during the contentious rule of the East India Company ensured the survival of Powis, and contributed to later modernisation of the castle and garden that transformed Powis into how it appears today.</p>

<p>Please note, well-behaved dogs on leads are allowed in the courtyard all year round, but only in the garden from 1 November to 28 February. The surrounding deer park is privately owned by Powis Estate, no dogs are allowed all year round and it&#39;s a permissive access path only.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lambert&#39;s Castle is the site of an Iron Age hill fort constructed by the local tribe dating back some 2,500 years; the ditch and bank are prominent as you approach the western entrance. More recently a fair was held here from 1709 to 1947, and there was also a horse-racing track. In 1806 a relay station was built. It was part of a chain of signal posts from Plymouth to London to warn of a French invasion during the Napoleonic war.</p>

<p>Head to Coney&#39;s Castle and you&#39;ll see that compared to many other hill forts, it&#39;s unusual because its ramparts enclose two separate areas. This may have been a larger hill fort reduced in size, a smaller hill fort extended or could&#39;ve been part of the original design.</p>

<p>The woodlands of Danbury and Lingwood Commons hide their 107 metre high ridge-top location on one of Essex&#39;s highest hills. For centuries, self-sufficient commoners under the Lord of the Manor&#39;s watchful eye came here to graze their domestic animals, cutting down scrub and trees for fuel and creating an open landscape. Today we carefully manage the commons in a similar way using simulated grazing by tractor to encourage the growth of rare flora and fauna.</p>

<p>See if you can trace clues to the commons unlikely use as a centre of military operation. From early times, Danbury&#39;s elevated position between the Crouch and Blackwater estuaries has been turned to strategic defence and army encampment. Between 1780 and 1815 threat came with the Napoleonic Wars whilst the First and Second World Wars saw the area used extensively as training grounds.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t miss exploring Blakes Wood, an ancient woodland on a sloping site spanning 100 acres of clear streams, valleys, mighty oaks, chestnuts and coppiced hornbeam. In spring our woodland floor is a riot of colourful wild flowers, including one of the best bluebell displays in the area, primrose and yellow archangel.</p>

<p>On the south-western edge of Danbury is Backwarden Nature Reserve, leased to Essex Wildlife Trust who manage a block of nearly 250 acres on Danbury Ridge; a mosaic of woodland, common and heath, streams and bogs. This is a great place to look out for wild flowers, reptiles (including adders), nesting birds and insects.</p>

Surrounded by ancient houses made from the local honey-coloured stone, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine the market-place alive with the bustle of traders from centuries past.</p>

<p>Built in 1627 by the town&#39;s wealthy benefactor, Sir Baptist Hicks, this landmark of the town was built to provide shelter for traders. Back then townsfolk would trade goods like cheese, butter and poultry. Walk along the ancient stone paved floor today and you&#39;ll get a sense of how important this building is to the town. The stone lovingly worn away by hundreds of years of bustling trading. You can almost hear the shouts and echoes from market traders long since gone.</p>

<p>In the 1940s it was almost sold to an American, but local people heroically raised the money to buy it first. They gave it to the National Trust so that people young and old can continue to cherish this delightful building.</p>

<p>Mount Stewart house has always been a &lsquo;home&rsquo; for the Londonderry family, a place that has been touched by the various generations who have loved it. Whilst always respecting the past and finding inspiration from its history, Mount Stewart has been unafraid of change throughout the generations, endeavouring to remain relevant in modern times, the result being that it still retains that feeling of a family home for all who visit with us.</p>

<p><strong>World Class Gardens</strong></p>

<p>The garden at Mount Stewart is unique and of rare quality, being one of the few late compartmentalised Arts and Crafts-like gardens. It is a deeply personal garden, the creation of Edith, Lady Londonderry in the early 20th century building on a pre-existing historic 18th and 19th century landscape. The Strong artistic theme is combined with an unrivalled plant collection which is protected and augmented via our nursery and propagation operation situated in the old walled garden.</p>

<p>Considered to be one of the most outstanding gardens in the world, Mount Stewart is the most visited National Trust mansion house property in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Demesne</strong></p>

<p>Mount Stewart is an exceptional example of the Irish demesne, intended to be both beautiful and productive, with woodland, orchards and farmland providing for the needs of the household. The demesne perimeter is clearly defined by an enclosing wall, which marked the private realm of the owner. Acquired by the Stewarts in 1744, woodlands they planted, the estate roads, the bridle paths, follys and farmland remain unchanged.&nbsp; Fine buildings of the Stable Block, Farmyards with Dovecote and Walled garden are architectural gems in their own right.</p>

<p>The wider demesne area was previously inaccessible to visitors, and historically was the realm of the family, their friends, and the house and estate staff, with the woodland in the care of a team of Woodsmen. Today they offer the public a wonderful opportunity to explore a rich landscape of farmed land and woodland walks, with monuments and buildings scattered throughout. Rich in a broad spectrum of recovering wildlife populations, the demesne is one of the last few strongholds of the native Red Squirrel. At the heart of the demesne lies the farmyard complex, along-side which sits the original walled garden, the former engine room of the estate.</p>

<p><strong>Temple of the Winds</strong></p>

<p>Positioned on a rise overlooking Strangford Lough, the octagonal Temple of the Winds is an eighteenth century, grade 1 listed building.&nbsp; Originally built as a banqueting hall and eye-catcher for Robert Stewart in 1786, its design is identical to the Tower of the Winds in Athens.&nbsp; James &lsquo;Athenian&rsquo; Stuart (1713-1788) designed the Temple.&nbsp; One of the pioneers of neo-Greek architecture in Europe, he saw sketched and measured the original Greek Tower whilst on tour, recreating it here at Mount Stewart.&nbsp; There are three floors including a vaulted basement that leads to a tunnel that held a wine cellar and scullery.</p>

Standing at 180ft tall the Cerne Giant is Britain&rsquo;s largest chalk hill figure and perhaps the best known.</p>

<p>Many theories have surrounded the giant&rsquo;s identity and origins, including ancient symbol of spirituality, likeness of the Greco-Roman hero Hercules, mockery of Oliver Cromwell and fertility aid. In 2021, after extensive scientific analysis, National Trust archaeologists concluded the giant was probably first constructed in the late Saxon period.</p>

<p>Above the giant is a rectangular earthwork enclosure, known as the Trendle, which is believed to date back to the Iron Age. It is still used today by local Morris Dancers as a site for May Day celebrations.</p>

<p>The giant was given to the National Trust in 1920. Part of conserving the giant means leaving it alone as much as possible &ndash; the chalk is replaced every decade or so, a process that takes days of work by National Trust rangers and volunteers. The more the ground is disturbed, the quicker the giant erodes away.</p>

<p>From different viewpoints, in different lights, the Giant can look starkly white or at times be just a faint outline. The best viewing spot for the Giant is from the Giant&rsquo;s View car park, but there is also a short walk up to the Giant&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>This is the only National Nature Reserve on the Isle of Wight. It is a beautiful retreat that has something to offer boat owners, walkers, wildlife enthusiasts and historians or just those in search of peace and tranquility. You can wander past flower-rich hay meadows, through ancient woodlands with rare butterflies and red squirrels, and look out over salt marsh and the clear waters of the harbour, bobbing with sailing boats in the summer and alive with birds in the spring and winter. For those on the water it is a beautiful place to explore and a good way to look out for wetland wildlife.</p>

<p>Newtown Harbour was saved in the 1960s from the threat of a nuclear power station being built near the harbour entrance.&nbsp; The efforts of local people conducting wildlife surveys proved to the authorities how special the place is. The landscape has remained little changed for decades and the pattern of fields reflects Newtown&#39;s Medieval origins.</p>

At Quarry Bank&nbsp;you can discover a complete industrial community and experience the very different worlds of owner and worker,&nbsp;who lived and worked here side by side.</p>

<p>In 1784, monumental change was brought to the village of Styal&nbsp;when Samuel Greg established his cotton mill. Powered by the water of the river Bollin and the toil of the workers, the Greg family business was part of a turning point in our history.</p>

<p>In the mill you can discover what it was like to work in a cotton mill. Experience heritage machinery in action and feel the floors shake beneath your feet as the spinning machines turn and the looms weave. Find out about the life and legacy of Samuel Greg, the founder of Quarry Bank, who arrived in England from Belfast as a young boy and went on to found a cotton empire. You can also discover more about the global cotton trade at the start of the Industrial Revolution and get a sense of the working conditions for the men, women and children who toiled in the mill. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You can explore the domestic life&nbsp;of the Greg family&nbsp;in their home, Quarry Bank House,&nbsp;and with a wander through the stunning picturesque gardens. Rising&nbsp;up the banks of the river valley, the gardens offer stunning views and spectacular changes through the seasons. In the restored glasshouse and kitchen garden, you can see the array of exotic fruits and vegetables that were grown for the wealthy Gregs&#39; table.</p>

<p>By contrast, take a guided tour of the Apprentice House to step into the lives of the pauper children who worked in the mill. Children as young as eight years old were apprenticed at Quarry Bank, working 10 hour days in the mill and living cramped together under the control of the Apprentice House superindentents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stroll to&nbsp;Styal village along the paths used by Quarry Bank&#39;s workforce to see how many of the other workers&nbsp;lived. In the village hub, a permanent exhibition explores the living conditions of the workers and the growth of Styal. A unique tour of a worker&#39;s cottage offers a fascinating insight into more than 150 years of history and invites you to compare your life to those of the workers. Styal remains a thriving community today and we ask you to be mindful of our tenants&#39; privacy.</p>

<p>On the estate there are acres of woodland to explore. Follow the meandering path of the river Bollin, and cross the folly bridges as you look out for an array of wildlife and beautiful views.</p>

<p>Birling Gap provides a point of entry for coastal walks and you can find our caf&eacute;, shop and visitor centre&nbsp;here on the cliff top. The beach below is ideal for seaside picnics with its rock pools and areas of pebbles and sand. It is a first class&nbsp;example of a marine nature reserve.</p>

<p>The wild forces of the sea create unusual chalk platforms and huge heaps of gleaming white chalk as the cliffs erode at up to one metre a year. Birling Gap can get busy so for a more secluded walk venture inland at Birling Gap or Crowlink. With over 500 acres of open chalk grassland the area is rich with butterflies and downland flowers. Nearby sites of archaeological interest, like Belle Tout neolithic enclosure, have much to tempt families further along the coast.</p>

This cottage, where Hardy was born in 1840, was built of cob and thatch by his great-grandfather and has been little altered since the family left.</p>

<p>Despite training as an architect, writing was Hardy&#39;s first love, and it was from here that he wrote several of his early short stories, poetry and novels including &#39;Under the Greenwood Tree&#39; and &#39;Far from the Madding Crowd&#39;.</p>

<p>The garden reflects most people&#39;s idea of a typical cottage garden, with roses around the door, and the sound of birdsong, even in winter. Once inside you will discover that 19th-century rural life, with its open hearths, small windows and stone floors, was not always idyllic.</p>

<p>The cottage sits next to Thorncombe Woods, owned and managed by Dorset Council. This is an ancient woodland and nature reserve that opens out onto heathland and the beginning of Hardy&#39;s Egdon Heath. Next to the Thorncombe Wood car park (Dorset Council, pay and display) you will find the Hardy&#39;s Birthplace Visitor Centre, run in partnership by Dorset Council and the National Trust.</p>

483,5148,Ventnor Downs,VentnorDowns,isleofwight@nationaltrust.org.uk,+441983741020,"<p>The Ventnor Downs rise steeply above the Victorian seaside town of Ventnor. With the sparkling sea below and the holm oak trees which have colonised the south facing chalk slopes there is almost a Mediterranean flavour to the landscape. On the top of the downs you find a complete change of landscape with large open areas of grass and heather. It is such a rewarding area to walk in as there is great variety and some wonderful wildlife spectacles at different times of year and you can enjoy fantastic views from this high position.</p>

<p>You can drive to the top of the downs where there are several car parks which lead onto areas of reasonably level footpaths. Or you can earn your supper by climbing the steep hills from the town of Ventnor. We share this wonderful place with ground nesting birds like skylark and meadow pipit so in spring please keep your dogs under close control and stick to established paths in the designated and signed areas. This can make so much difference to the survival of these vulnerable birds.</p>

<p>You may be lucky to catch a glimpse of the herd of Old English goats which graze on Bonchurch Down and Coombe Bottom. They were introduced to the downs in 1993 to help control the spread of scrub and holm oak trees which would otherwise rapidly re-colonise the flower rich chalk grassland.</p>

<br />
Built in 1653 on the instructions of Sir Robert Shirley Fourth Baronet, this is a rare building of its time, an era known as the Commonwealth Period, when Oliver Cromwell was Lord Protector of England.<br />
<br />
Building this chapel was Sir Robert&rsquo;s way of standing up for &lsquo;all thinges sacred&rsquo; as he saw it: the High Anglican Church and the God-given right of the monarch to rule.</p>

<p>Staunton Harold Church, or the Chapel of the Holy Trinity as it is also known, is a fine example of Gothic style, which continued into the middle of the seventeenth century. The oak box pews and wood panelling are made from local oak by the Melbourne joiner William Smith.

Restored in the 19th century, it is a unique mixture of Tudor simplicity and Victorian Arts and Crafts&#39; aesthetics.</p>

<p>Built by the devout Catholic Norris family, eager to impress visitors with the grandeur of their home, Speke Hall embodies more than 400 years of turbulent history. Its secret priest hole reflects Catholic persecution in the Tudor period, whilst much of the Hall&rsquo;s upkeep was financed first by the Norris family&rsquo;s, and later by the Watt family&rsquo;s, longstanding involvement in transatlantic slavery. From building the world&rsquo;s largest slave trading port to slave-ownership, investment in slave-trading voyages and shipping of slave-produced goods, these aspects of the owners&rsquo; histories are embedded in the Hall&rsquo;s walls. During the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, Speke Hall experienced years of neglect and decay, including a spell when it was used as a cow shed. Finally pulled into the Victorian era of improvement and technology, the Hall was resuscitated with a Gothic revival style.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, Speke Hall and its surrounding estate provide a place to reflect on past and present, and about how the legacies of history remain relevant today. The Hall is surrounded by restored gardens and protected by a collar of woodland.</p>

<p>A rare surviving example of an urban working corn mill, the City Mill was rebuilt in 1744. Having entered the care of the National Trust in the late 1920&rsquo;s, the City Mill was restored back to full working order in 2004.</p>

<p>Inside, you&rsquo;ll discover more about the mill&rsquo;s long and fascinating history. See the mill in action and learn how we produce traditional stoneground wholemeal flour using the power of the River Itchen. Our team of volunteer millers provide flour milling demonstrations (subject to availabilty)</p>

<p>Discover how our freshly milled stoneground flour is combined with local seasonal ingredients to produce delicious treats in our onsite cafe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The City Mill is home to a wide variety of wildlife including kingfishers, grey wagtails, wild trout and water voles, which can be spotted from our tranquil island garden. Watch our city otters&rsquo; adventures from regularly updated archive footage and view the live feed from our cameras along the river.</p>

<p>The Common has had an interesting past: it was used as an army training ground during the Second World War, and during the 1950s and 1960s it suffered terrible fires which swept across the open heath. This later period was also the time when grazing ceased on Marley and the common soon became overgrown with scrub and trees.</p>

<p>Today, after much work and the introduction of belted Galloway cattle, Marley is returning to its former glory. A chestnut woodland provides us with fuel and fencing material. The wood is valuable as a renewable source, but the true value of coppicing lies in the wildlife that responds to recently cleared glades.</p>

On the Parade Ground stand two original guns, hauled up from the seas below where they were thrown years ago. Follow the underground tunnel as it twists and turns deep into the chalky cliffs and you&rsquo;ll find a searchlight emplacement with views high above the Needles rocks and as far as Dorset on a clear day.</p>

<p>Further up the headland stands the New Battery. Here a small exhibition and a recreation of one of the rooms, reveals the astonishing and little-known story of Britain&#39;s Cold War &#39;race for space&#39;, when British-made rockets were tested here under conditions of great secrecy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s astonishing to think that this stone cottage&nbsp;was where a young George and his entire family lived, in just one room. At the time of George&rsquo;s birth in 1781, the house - known as High Street House -&nbsp;was divided into tenements for four families. Outside,&nbsp;ran the wooden waggonway along which horses pulled &#39;chaldrons&#39;&nbsp;containing coal from Wylam Colliery to the Tyne quayside.</p>

<p>George worked with his father at the colliery moving coal and driving the gin horses. Showing promise&nbsp;and ambition, George&nbsp;soon gained&nbsp;the post of engineman at a pit down the Tyne near Newburn. A great career had begun. The&nbsp;Liverpool to Manchester Railway opened on 15<sup>th</sup> September 1830. And just the day before, Stephenson&rsquo;s &#39;Rocket&#39;&nbsp;won the competition for the engine to pull the waggons to Rainhill (Manchester); the others did not finish the course.</p>

<p>Visitors can&nbsp;walk or cycle along the Wylam Waggonway, which runs past the Birthplace, and follow the course of the River Tyne, spotting a variety of wildlife along the way.</p>
